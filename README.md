# Zero Coupon Bonds
A zero coupon bond is a bond that pays out a defined amount of an asset at a specific time with no other payments or coupons. These bonds are sometimes refered to as strip bonds.

# How it Works 
This project allows users to buy zero coupon bonds on the open market or sell them against their collateral. These bonds are collateralised by Aave's aTokens.
This allows users to continue to recieve the yield generated by their collateral up until the time at which the bonds mature.

# Yield Curves for Everything
The emergence of zero coupon bonds on Ethereum allows users to choose between the yield generated by longer term time deposits and money markets. This is a smilple yet elegant solution to one of the greatest problems facing Ethereum, maturity of capital markets and creation of yield curves. This has the potential to be the use case that drives the next wave of adoption for defi. This allows users to easily get exposure to a fixed yield over a fixed period of time. The presence of yield curves in Ethereum capital markets allows for much greater maturation of these markets.
